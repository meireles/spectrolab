# spectrolab

``spectrolab`` **breaks backwards compatibility!** The function `wavelengths` is now `bands` and the function `reflectance` is now `value`. Please use the `legacy` branch if you want to use the older api. 


~~The package is being actively developed and parts of the *API may still change*. Youâ€™re welcome to give it a spin, but do so *at your own risk*. With that said, most parts of the package are pretty stable. Let us know if you find otherwise~~.

## Installation

You can install spectrolab from CRAN using:

```R
install.packages("spectrolab")
```

## Using `spectrolab`

This vignette [introduces spectrolab](vignettes/introduction_to_spectrolab.pdf), and walks you through the basics of the package.

This vignette shows how to [splice sensors](vignettes/match_sensors.pdf) using the function  `match_sensors` and explains the details about how its arguments work. A more general processing vignette is coming soon.


## Contributing

In an effort to keep things tidy and in running order, __direct commits to master are discouraged__. The master branch of the "meireles/spectrolab" fork is protected.

I also use a [__pre-commit hook__](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40462111/git-prevent-commits-in-master-branch) in my local repo that prevents me from breaking my own policy! I suggest you do the same. 

We highly encourage you to read the vignette on [advanced spectrolab use](vignettes/advanced_spectrolab.pdf) if you're planning on contributing to or developing a package that depends on `spectrolab`.
