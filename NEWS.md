## major 
* *NOT backwards compatible!*. Now, as.spectra() does not assume by default that
  the first column of a matrix or data.frame contains the names for the spectra.
  Users must explicitly use the `name_idx` argument to pick the correct column
* *NOT backwards compatible!*. `enforce01` functions and attibute deprecared.
