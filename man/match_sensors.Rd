\title{Match spectra at sensor transitions}
\usage{
match_sensors(
  x,
  splice_at,
  fixed_sensor = 2,
  interpolate_wvl = 5,
  factor_range = c(0.5, 3)
)

\method{match_sensors}{spectra}(
  x,
  splice_at,
  fixed_sensor = 2,
  interpolate_wvl = 5,
  factor_range = c(0.5, 3)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{spectra object}

\item{splice_at}{bands that serve as splice points, i.e the beginnings
of the rightmost sensor. Must be length 1 or 2 (max 3 sensors)}

\item{fixed_sensor}{sensor to keep fixed. Can be 1 or 2 if matching 2 sensors.
If matching 3 sensors, `fixed_sensor` must be 2 (default).}

\item{interpolate_wvl}{extent around splice_at values over which the splicing
factors will be calculated. Defaults to 5}

\item{factor_range}{range of acceptable correction factors (min, max).
Defaults to c(0.5, 3)}
}

\description{
\code{match_sensors} scales values of sensors 1 (vis) and 3 (swir2)
}
\details{
Splice_at has no default because sensor transition points vary between vendors
and individual instruments. It is an important parameter though, so you should
visually inspect your spectra before assigning it.
Typical values in our own individual instruments were:
SVC ~ c(990, 1900),
ASD ~ c(1001, 1801).

If the factors used to match spectra are unreasonable, \code{match_sensors}
will throw. Unreasonable factors (f) are defined as 0.5 > f > 3 or NaN,
which happens when the value for the right sensor is 0.
