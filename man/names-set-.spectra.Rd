\description{
\code{names} assigns sample names to lhs
}
\details{
Sample names must not be coercible to numeric. That is, names such as "1" and
"153.44" are invalid even if they are encoded as character. names will add the
prefix "spec_" to any element of value that is coercible to numeric.
}
\examples{
library(spectrolab)
spec = as_spectra(spec_matrix_example, name_idx = 1)
names(spec) = toupper(names(spec))
